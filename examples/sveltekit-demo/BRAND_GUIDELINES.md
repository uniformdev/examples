## Visual Style

### Overall Aesthetic

- **High contrast** between dark immersive sections and clean white sections
- **Generous whitespace** in product displays
- **Soft shadows and glows** rather than hard edges

### Hero Sections
- Dark cosmic backgrounds with aurora borealis effects
- Animated gradient layers in cherry red, magenta, violet, and teal
- Subtle starfield with twinkling animation
- Floating glow orbs with soft blur
- White text on dark for maximum contrast

### Product Photography Style
- Clean, minimal backgrounds (white or soft gray)
- Dramatic lighting with subtle colored rim lights
- Floating/levitating product presentation
- Soft shadows suggesting depth
- High-key or product-focused lighting

### UI Elements
- **Buttons:** Rounded full (pill shape), solid fills
- **Cards:** Large border radius (1rem), subtle shadows
- **Glassmorphism:** Used sparingly for overlays (white/10 with backdrop blur)
- **Hover states:** Scale transforms, color transitions, reveal animations

## Animation Principles

### Motion Guidelines
- **Smooth and fluid:** Ease-in-out timing, 300-700ms durations
- **Purposeful:** Animations guide attention, not distract
- **Layered:** Multiple elements animate at different rates for depth

### Signature Animations
- **Float:** Gentle vertical bobbing (6s cycle)
- **Aurora waves:** Slow, organic movement of gradient layers (12-20s cycles)
- **Fade up:** Content reveals with upward motion
- **Scale in:** Elements grow from 95% to 100%
- **Star twinkle:** Subtle opacity pulsing
