# Algolia integration starter

This starter is based on Next.js and it showcases two main use cases of Algolia <> Uniform integration:
1. Ability to register Algolia components from `react-instantsearch-hooks-web` as Canvas components (see the `/components` folder). After the Algolia integration is installed into your Uniform project, you will see new Algolia components added to your component library. This project contains the sample front-end implementation of those components.
2. Pre-wired enhancer for Algolia allowing to fetch data for any Canvas component that has Algolia parameter with a value.

## Getting Started

1. `npm install` or `yarn`

1. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
