# Uniform - custom integration tutorial

This is a supporting tutorial for [this document](https://docs.uniform.app/tutorials/custom-integrations/basic-nextjs/steps) which demonstrates how to build a custom integration for Uniform Mesh.

# Pre-requisites

1. Uniform project, sign up for free [here](https://uniform.app)
1. Yarn
   > Important: using yarn is temporarily required for this codebase.

# Getting started

1. Set the variables in `apps\demo-monsterpedia\.env` to match the settings that apply to your Uniform project.
1. `yarn`
1. `npm run canvas:basic:push`
1. In a new browser window, open Uniform and publish the composition Home Page.
1. `npm run dev:basic`

As a result, the mesh app will run on localhost:4030 and the demo app with the front-end will run on localhost:4040.
